# OKRs for Self Learning
Sophia's [self learning plan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1HAFmN-UvrFHBYnMRrjpgCKGGjZT1sZnnWI5YfOrw0uo/edit?pli=1#gid=0) on becoming a software engineer, Objectives and Key Results (OKR) style. 

The OKRs methodology is for anyone for wants to set up an ambitious and measurable plan to achieve their goals, any goals. The resources below are for anyone who wants to explore or start a career in software engineer or software development. 

Self learning is still (and is always) in progress! This repo is actively updated with new resources and learnings.

## What are OKRs?
Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) are a strategic planning tool used by many tech organizations such as Google to establish cross functional team alignment, which ultimately helps move the needle closer to achieving the organization's mission.

**Objectives** are ambitious goals. If your objectives make you feel uncomfortable, that's a sign you're setting up your OKRs with a healthy amount of rigor!

To determine *objectives*, ask yourself, *"Where do you want to go?"*.

**Key results** are measurable and specific milestones that directly contribute to the objective. Key results are outcomes, not activities.

To determine *key results*, ask yourself, *"How will I pace myself to see if I am getting there?"*.

**While OKRs are typically used by organizations for strategic planning to create alignment between teams, I've adapted OKRs for [my own goal setting and tracking](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1HAFmN-UvrFHBYnMRrjpgCKGGjZT1sZnnWI5YfOrw0uo/edit?pli=1#gid=0) for my self learning journey on being a software engineer.**

For more information on OKRs, here's [Google's guide on OKRs](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/set-goals-with-okrs/steps/introduction/), an easy to read and comprehesive overview of how to create and use OKRs.

## Why use OKRs?
- Focus and accountability over three month increments.
- OKRs are *not* a task list! When designed right, ambitious OKRs help keep you motivated and on track your progress!


## How to use it
Feel free to use [my OKRs spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1HAFmN-UvrFHBYnMRrjpgCKGGjZT1sZnnWI5YfOrw0uo/edit?pli=1#gid=0) as a template for your own self study plan. 
1. Brainstorm possible objectives, using the question, "Where do you want to go?", as a starting point. Ask yourself "What does wild success look like?" to think big.
2. Narrow down your objectives to 5-6. 
3. Brainstorm possible KRs, using the the question, "How will I pace myself to see if I am getting there?", as a guide. 
4. Narrow down and prioritize KRs that will get you closest to achieving your objective. You should have no more than 5 KRs per objective.
	Reminder: KRs are not a to-do list!
5. Get validation and feedback on your OKRs, preferably those who can give constructive feedback through their own experience or expertise.
6. Get started on crushing your OKRs!
7. Update your OKRs weekly to track your progress.
8. Reflect monthly and adjust as needed throughout the quarter. OKRs are not set in stone!
9. Do a retrospective at the end of the quarter to apply learning to your next set of OKRs.

## Questions for Coffee Chats
Coffee chats are a great casual way to build your community, learn and hear first-hand experiences. If you're stuck on what to ask, here are some questions to help get the conversation started:
- What does a day-to-day look like in your role?
- Can I get your feedback on X? 
- What are some challenges you face in your work?
- What is something new you are learning right now?
- What do you enjoy doing outside of work?
- Is there anything I can support you in?
